        I first began taking yoga classes in high school at Frog Lotus Yoga in North Adams, MA. My passion for yoga evolved over a decade of practice. I remain a devoted follower of the Frog Lotus Yoga School, recently completing my 200 hour CYT certificate in Thailand, under the incredible instruction of Jennifer Yarro. 
      <br />
        I am grateful for the playful and creative, yet intelligent & mindful style of yoga that my many wonderful instructors instilled in my practice. I aims to bring this sense of playfulness, creativity, intelligence, & mindfulness to every class I instruct.
